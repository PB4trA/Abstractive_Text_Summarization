      "planted; to inspire people with your cheerful attitude while you are going through such \n",
      "obviously difficult times.  In the process you will inspire others to choose the noble and \n",
      "positive outlook. \n",
      " \n",
      "Or (b) this book will inspire you to take action to make a bold and daring move; to make a \n",

      " \n",
      "Politicians used the depressed state of the country to their advantage.  It provided a great \n",
      "opportunity to highlight the failures, shortcomings, and faults of the opposite political party.  \n",
      "Democrats found in it an opportunity to blame the Republican administration which was in \n",

      " \n",
      "No one could deny that the country had problems.  But the biggest problem we had was our \n",
      "attitude toward the economic problem.  Negative thinking spread like a plague through all \n",
      "levels of society.  It was not easy to protect oneself from the infection of negative thinking, \n",
      "which spread by word of mouth, by conversations with friends as well as strangers, by \n",
      "television screens, and by radio news reports. \n",
      " \n",
      "It spread quickly because in recessive times the tendency is to react negatively.  Once and \n",
      "organism, a business, a life, or a country is infected with negative thinking, the infection \n",
      "attacks the mind, the heart, and the soul like termites that secretly gnaw away at the \n",
